# Blacklake RP Config files

---

## How do I contribute?
Easiest way is to press '.' on your keyboard

Edit the file you want to change

Once you have made all your changes, press 'Ctrl+Shift+G'

Hover over the file you changed, and press the '+' button.

Enter a message like `[dev] Changed server name to xyz` (keep it short)

And press the big green tick arrow.

## Why github..?
Most people do not need SSH access just to change a config file. This is a simple way to let people work together.

## How do I get the change to apply..?
The server will auto sync with this repo on restart. Do not worry about the rest ;)
